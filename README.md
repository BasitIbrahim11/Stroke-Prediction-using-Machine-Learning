# 🧠 Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a **stroke** in patients using clinical and demographic features. The dataset includes real-world medical data such as age, hypertension, heart disease history, glucose level, and BMI. Machine Learning models are trained to classify whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke or not.
